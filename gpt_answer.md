## Q1
### Q1-1
```
The command to move harry's chamber.txt to ron's proj1 directory using relative path would be:

> mv chamber.txt ../ron/proj1/

This assumes that you are currently in the 'harry' directory and want to move the 'chamber.txt' file to the 'proj1' directory located in the 'ron' directory. 
The '..' notation in the command refers to the parent directory of the current directory, which is the /home directory in this case.
```

### Q1-2
```
The command to read the first 7 lines of stone.txt from the current directory (ron/proj1) would be:

> head -n 7 ../harry/stone.txt

This command uses the head command to display the first 7 lines of the file stone.txt. 
The ../ notation is used to refer to the parent directory of the current directory, which is ron.
Therefore, ../harry/stone.txt is the relative path to the stone.txt file in Harry's directory.
```

### Q1-3
```
To move to the 'hermione' directory, we can use the following command:

> cd ../hermione

To uncompress the 'proj2.gz' file in 'harry' directory, we can use the following command:

> gunzip ../harry/proj2.gz

The final structure of the /home folder will be:

  ├── harry
  │      ├── chamber.txt
  │      ├── proj2
  │      └── stone.txt
  ├── hermione
  │      ├── necklace.txt
  │      └── proj2.gz
  └── ron
           ├── frost.txt
           ├── proj1
           │      ├── data.txt
           │      └── workflow.sh
           └── wand.txt

Note that the 'proj2.gz' file in the 'harry' directory has been uncompressed and the resulting 'proj2' directory has been created in the 'harry' directory.
```

### Q1-4
```
The absolute path to Harry's directory is /home/harry. 
To remove every txt file in Harry's directory, you can use the rm command with the -f option to force the removal of the files without prompting for confirmation.
Here's the command you can use:

> rm -f /home/harry/*.txt

This will remove every txt file in Harry's directory, including chamber.txt and stone.txt.
```

## Q2
### Q2-1
```
This command will extract the third column of the Saccharomyces_cerevisiae.gtf file using awk, 
which contains information about the feature type of each line (e.g. gene, transcript, exon, CDS, start_codon, stop_codon). 
Then, it will pipe this output to sort, which will sort the feature types alphabetically. Finally, the sorted feature types will be passed to uniq -c, which will count the number of occurrences of each feature type.
The expected output of this command would be something like:

   2 CDS
   4 exon
   4 gene
   2 start_codon
   2 stop_codon
   2 transcript

This indicates that there are two CDS features, four exon features, four gene features, two start_codon features, two stop_codon features, 
and two transcript features in the input file. The counts may be different depending on the specific input file used.
```

### Q2-2
```
The command awk -F'\t' '{print NR,FNR}' Saccharomyces_cerevisiae.gtf will print the record number (NR) and file record number (FNR) of each line in the Saccharomyces_cerevisiae.gtf file. 
The output will be:

   1 1
   2 1
   3 1
   4 1
   5 1
   6 1
   7 1
   8 1
   9 1
   10 1
   11 1
   12 1
   13 1

The NR value starts from 1 and increments for each line of input, while FNR value starts from 1 for each new file processed and increments for each line of that file. 
Since there is only one file being processed, NR and FNR values are the same.
```

### Q2-3
```
To calculate the length of the gene on the negative strand, we need to extract the lines with "gene" feature on the negative strand and then calculate the length using the start and end coordinates.
One way to do this using Unix commands is:

> grep 'gene.*-\s' Saccharomyces_cerevisiae.gtf | awk '{sum+=($5-$4+1)} END {print sum}'

Here, grep is used to search for lines that contain the pattern "gene" and "-" (for negative strand) in the file "Saccharomyces_cerevisiae.gtf". 
The output of grep is then piped (using |) to awk, which calculates the length by summing up the differences between the end ($5) and start ($4) coordinates of each line, 
and adding 1 to account for the length of the gene. The final result is printed using print.
```

### Q2-4
```
Here's the output of the command for the given "Saccharomyces_cerevisiae.gtf" file:

  1074

This means that the total length of genes on the negative strand in the file is 1074 nucleotides.
```

---

## Q3
### Q3-1
```
You can use the grep command to search for lines containing the string "GTA" in the contigs.fasta file and then use the wc command to count the number of lines that contain this string.
Here's the command:

> grep -c "GTA" contigs.fasta

The -c option in grep tells it to count the number of lines that match the search string "GTA" in the file contigs.fasta. 
The output of this command will be the number of lines containing "GTA" in the file.
```

### Q3-2
```
To find a motif and color it in contigs.fasta, we can use the command line tool grep to search for the motif and then use the sed command to color it. 
Here's an example command that finds the motif "CGTACGTAG" and colors it red in the contigs.fasta file:

> grep -A 1 "CGTACGTAG" contigs.fasta | sed "s/CGTACGTAG/\x1b[31m&\x1b[0m/g"

grep -A 1 "CGTACGTAG" contigs.fasta searches for the motif "CGTACGTAG" in the contigs.fasta file and prints the matching line and the line after it (-A 1 option).
sed "s/CGTACGTAG/\x1b[31m&\x1b[0m/g" colors the motif red by replacing each occurrence of "CGTACGTAG" with the same string surrounded by the escape codes for red color (\x1b[31m and \x1b[0m). 
The & character in the replacement string refers to the matched pattern.
Note that this command assumes that the motif appears only once in each contig, and that the motif is in uppercase letters without any spaces or other characters. 
If the motif can have variations in case or spacing, you may need to modify the command accordingly.
```

### Q3-3
```
To calculate the GC content of each contig, we can simply count the number of G's and C's in each sequence and divide by the total length of the sequence.

For contig1:

Number of G's: 9
Number of C's: 13
Total length: 35
GC content of contig1 = (9 + 13) / 35 = 0.62 or 62%

For contig2:

Number of G's: 12
Number of C's: 10
Total length: 35
GC content of contig2 = (12 + 10) / 35 = 0.57 or 57%
```

## Q4
### Q4-1
```
Based on the overlap between the reads, the edges of the overlap graph can be represented as follows:

  source,target
  ACCTA,CTACG
  CTACG,TACGT
  TACGT,GTCAC
  GTCAC,CGAAC
```

### Q4-2
```
Using the overlap graph approach, the reads can be assembled into the following sequence:

  ACCTACGTCAACG

The shortest path that visits all edges at least once is the same as the assembled sequence above.
```

Using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm and the given scoring system, the alignment matrix would look like:

    
    | - | - | G | C | A | T | G |
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
    | - |  0| -4| -8|-12|-16|-20|
    | G | -4|  2| -2| -6|-10|-14|
    | T |- 8| -2|  2| -2| -6|-10|
    | C |-12|- 4| -2| -4| -2|- 6|
    | A |-16|- 8|- 2| -6|  0|- 4|
    | G |-20|-12|- 2|-10|- 4|  2|
    

The first row and column represent gaps in the sequences. The score in the top-left corner is zero, representing the alignment of two gaps. The score in each cell is calculated based on the scores of the adjacent cells and the scores for matches, mismatches, and gaps according to the given scoring system.

In this case, the optimal alignment score is 2, which can be found in the bottom-right cell of the matrix.
```

### Q5-2
```
Based on the alignment matrix in Q6-1, the optimal alignment can be found by tracing back from the bottom-right corner to the top-left corner, following the path of the highest scores. In this case, there are multiple optimal alignments, but one possible alignment is:


Horizontal:  G | C | A | T | G
Vertical  :    |   |   |   |  
Alignment : - | - | G | C | A | T | G


where the "|" symbol represents the alignment point, and "-" represents a gap in the sequence. 

Note that this alignment is not unique and there may be other possible alignments with the same optimal score.
```

### Q5-3
```
The Smith-Waterman algorithm allows for local alignment by finding the highest scoring local alignment between two sequences, rather than requiring a global alignment of the entire sequences.

To determine the flag score for each read, we need to examine the binary representation of the flag field. Here is a breakdown of the different flag values:

    
    Flag   Bit     Description
    1      0x1     read paired
    2      0x2     read mapped in proper pair
    4      0x4     read unmapped
    8      0x8     mate unmapped
    16     0x10    read reverse strand
    32     0x20    mate reverse strand
    64     0x40    first in pair
    128    0x80    second in pair
    256    0x100   not primary alignment
    512    0x200   read fails platform/vendor quality checks
    1024   0x400   read is PCR or optical duplicate
    2048   0x800   supplementary alignment

For read A, read 1 is on the forward strand and read 2 is on the reverse strand. Both reads are properly mapped and paired, so the flag score is:

    Flag = 0x1 | 0x2 | 0x40 | 0x80 = 0xC1

For read B, read 2 is on the forward strand and read 1 is on the reverse strand. Both reads are properly mapped and paired, so the flag score is:

    Flag = 0x1 | 0x2 | 0x40 | 0x80 = 0xC1

Therefore, the flag score for read A is 1 and the flag score for read B is 2.

    A,1
    B,2

## Q8
### Q8-1

To find informative positions for drawing a phylogenetic tree, we need to look for positions where the sequences differ from each other. One way to do this is to look for positions with gaps or positions where there are different nucleotides or amino acids among the sequences. 

Using this approach, we can identify the informative positions in the given multiple sequence alignment as follows:

    pos 0123456789
    s1  CGCTAGTCGA
    s2  CGGGC-TCTA
    s3  CCGTGGTCGA
    s4  CCGGT-TGTA

At position 3 and 7, we can see that there are different nucleotides among the sequences. Therefore, these positions are informative for drawing a phylogenetic tree. 

So, the answer is:
3,7
```

### Q8-2

To determine which of the three trees best represents the given alignment, we need to consider the relationships between the sequences in the tree and compare them to the multiple sequence alignment. 

    A: ((1,4),(2,3))
    B: ((1,2),(3,4))
    C: ((1,3),(2,4))

Let's compare each tree to the alignment:

- Tree A: In this tree, sequences 1 and 4 are grouped together, and sequences 2 and 3 are grouped together. This grouping is consistent with the alignment at positions 3 and 7, where sequences 1 and 4 have a C, and sequences 2 and 3 have a T. However, it is not consistent with the alignment at position 5, where sequence 1 has a A and sequence 4 has a G. Therefore, Tree A does not represent the alignment well.

- Tree B: In this tree, sequences 1 and 2 are grouped together, and sequences 3 and 4 are grouped together. This grouping is consistent with the alignment at position 5, where sequences 1 and 2 have a G, and sequences 3 and 4 have a T. However, it is not consistent with the alignment at positions 3 and 7, where sequences 1 and 4 have a C, and sequences 2 and 3 have a T. Therefore, Tree B does not represent the alignment well.

- Tree C: In this tree, sequences 1 and 3 are grouped together, and sequences 2 and 4 are grouped together. This grouping is consistent with the alignment at positions 3, 5, and 7, where sequences 1 and 3 have a C, sequences 2 and 4 have a T at position 7, and sequences 1 and 2 have a G, and sequences 3 and 4 have a T at position 5. Therefore, Tree C represents the alignment best.

So, the answer is: Tree C represents the alignment best.

## Q9
```
In the context of genomic assembly, affine and non-affine gap cost algorithms have different effects on the accuracy and efficiency of sequence alignment.
Affine gap cost algorithms use separate costs for gap opening and gap extension, while non-affine gap cost algorithms use a single cost for both gap opening and gap extension.
One advantage of using an affine gap cost algorithm is that it can more accurately model biological evolution, which often involves the insertion or deletion of multiple nucleotides at once, resulting in longer gaps. As a result, affine gap cost algorithms tend to produce more accurate alignments and result in higher assembly quality, particularly when dealing with longer reads.
On the other hand, non-affine gap cost algorithms tend to be more computationally efficient than affine gap cost algorithms, as they require fewer calculations. This can be advantageous when dealing with large datasets or when computational resources are limited.
In summary, while affine gap cost algorithms tend to produce more accurate alignments, non-affine gap cost algorithms can be more efficient in terms of computational resources. The choice of algorithm ultimately depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the assembly project at hand.

## Q10
```
An E-value of 10 suggests that the match between your query sequence and the hit sequence could have occurred by chance 10 times in a database of that size. The lower the E-value, the more significant the match. The next step would be to evaluate the significance of the match further by looking at the alignment score, percent identity, and coverage, and considering the biological relevance of the hit. If the hit appears to be biologically relevant, further analysis and experimental validation may be required.
```

## Q11
```
Here's a possible workflow for analyzing the genome sequence data of the hyperthermophile and comparing it to non-hyperthermophile genomes:

1. Quality control of reads: Check the quality of reads and remove any low-quality reads using software such as Trimmomatic or FastQC.
2. Genome assembly: Assemble the high-quality reads into contigs or scaffolds using an assembler like SPAdes or Canu.
3. Genome annotation: Annotate the genome with gene models and functional annotations using software like Prokka or RAST.
4. Quality assessment: Evaluate the quality of the assembled genome using software like QUAST or BUSCO.
5. Comparative genomics: Conduct comparative analysis of the hyperthermophile genome with other available non-hyperthermophile genomes, to identify similarities and differences. This can be achieved by using software like Roary or OrthoFinder to identify orthologous genes, and tools like Mauve or progressiveMauve to align the genomes.
6. Phylogenomics: Construct a phylogenetic tree to reveal the evolutionary relationship of the hyperthermophile with other organisms. This can be achieved by concatenating multiple orthologous genes or using whole-genome alignment, and then using software like RAxML or IQ-TREE to infer the phylogeny.
7. Functional analysis: Analyze the functions of unique genes found in the hyperthermophile genome compared to non-hyperthermophile genomes, and identify any potential adaptive mechanisms that may enable the organism to thrive in extreme conditions.

It is important to note that the workflow may differ depending on the characteristics of the hyperthermophile genome and the non-hyperthermophile genomes being compared. Additionally, there may be some technical challenges involved in dealing with a hyperthermophile genome, such as the need to use specialized DNA extraction protocols to preserve the integrity of the DNA at high temperatures.
